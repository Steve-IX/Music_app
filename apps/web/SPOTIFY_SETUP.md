# üéµ Spotify Web Playback SDK Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up Spotify integration for in-site playback using the official Web Playback SDK.

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Redirect URI Configuration**

The most common issue is **"INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI"**. Follow these exact steps:

### **Step 1: Configure Redirect URIs in Spotify Dashboard**

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**
2. **Click on your MusicStream app**
3. **Click "Edit Settings"**
4. **In the "Redirect URIs" section, add BOTH:**
   ```
   https://music-app-eta-vert.vercel.app/spotify-callback
   http://localhost:3000/spotify-callback
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `music-app-eta-vert.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel domain**

5. **Click "Save"**

### **Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables**

Create/update your `.env.local` file in `apps/web/`:

```env
# Spotify Web API & Web Playback SDK
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Optional: Override redirect URI (useful for custom domains)
# VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-custom-domain.com/spotify-callback

# Other APIs (optional)
VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
VITE_JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID=your_jamendo_client_id_here
```

### **Step 3: Restart Your App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User clicks "Connect Spotify" button
2. Redirected to Spotify OAuth
3. User authorizes the app
4. Redirected to `/spotify-callback` page
5. Callback page processes the authorization code
6. Tokens stored securely in localStorage
7. Web Playback SDK initialized with tokens

### **Playback Flow**
1. **Spotify Preview URLs** (30s snippets) ‚Üí Play via Howler.js
2. **Spotify Web URLs** (full tracks) ‚Üí Attempt in-site via Web Playback SDK
3. **Fallback** ‚Üí Open in Spotify app if in-site fails

## üîí **Security & Privacy**

### **What Gets Stored**
- Access tokens (localStorage, auto-expire)
- Refresh tokens (localStorage, encrypted)
- User preferences (localStorage)

### **What We Can Access**
- Read your profile information
- Control playback on your devices
- Read your playlists and library
- **We CANNOT:** See your password, billing info, or private data

### **Data Usage**
- Tokens stay in your browser
- No server-side storage of your Spotify data
- Tokens automatically refresh when needed

## üì± **User Experience**

### **First Time Setup**
1. User sees "Connect Spotify" button
2. Clicks to start authentication
3. Redirected to Spotify login
4. Authorizes MusicStream app
5. Returns to app, now connected
6. Can play Spotify tracks in-site

### **Daily Usage**
1. User searches for music
2. Spotify tracks show with play buttons
3. Clicking play attempts in-site playback
4. If successful, track plays in MusicStream
5. If not, opens in Spotify app
6. User can control playback from MusicStream

## ‚úÖ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:

‚úÖ **Console shows:** `üîê Spotify Auth Config: clientId: ‚úÖ Set, redirectUri: https://your-domain.com/spotify-callback`  
‚úÖ **"Connect Spotify" button** changes to "Connected"  
‚úÖ **Spotify tracks** play directly in the site  
‚úÖ **No "INVALID_CLIENT" errors** in console  
‚úÖ **Playback controls** work smoothly  

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

### **Check the Browser Console**
Look for these specific messages:
- `üîê Spotify Auth Config:` - Shows your configuration
- `‚ùå Spotify OAuth error:` - Shows specific OAuth errors
- `‚úÖ Successfully obtained Spotify tokens` - Confirms successful auth

### **Verify Your Redirect URIs**
1. Copy your exact domain from the browser address bar
2. Add `/spotify-callback` to the end
3. Make sure this EXACT URL is in your Spotify Dashboard
4. Check for typos, extra characters, or wrong protocols (http vs https)

### **Test Locally First**
1. Make sure it works on `http://localhost:3000` first
2. Add both localhost and production URLs to Spotify Dashboard
3. Test the production deployment after local testing works

### **Check Environment Variables**
1. Verify `.env.local` is in the correct folder (`apps/web/`)
2. Check that variables start with `VITE_`
3. Restart the development server after changes
4. Check browser console for config logs

---

**üí° Pro Tip:** The redirect URI must match EXACTLY. Even a trailing slash or wrong protocol will cause the INVALID_CLIENT error.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **App name**: `MusicStream`
   - **App description**: `Music streaming web application`
   - **Website**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000/spotify-callback`
4. Accept the terms and click "Save"

### 2. Get Your Credentials

1. Click on your new app in the dashboard
2. Copy the **Client ID** (visible immediately)
3. Click "Show Client Secret" and copy it
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep these secure!**

### 3. Create Environment File

Create `.env.local` in the `apps/web/` directory:

```env
# Spotify Web API & Web Playback SDK
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Other APIs (optional)
VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
VITE_JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID=your_jamendo_client_id_here
```

### 4. Restart Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Spotify" button
2. Redirected to Spotify OAuth
3. User authorizes the app
4. Redirected back with authorization code
5. App exchanges code for access tokens
6. Tokens stored securely in localStorage
7. Web Playback SDK initialized with tokens

### Playback Flow
1. **Spotify Preview URLs** (30s snippets) ‚Üí Play via Howler.js
2. **Spotify Web URLs** (full tracks) ‚Üí Attempt in-site via Web Playback SDK
3. **Fallback** ‚Üí Open in Spotify app if in-site fails

### Requirements
- ‚úÖ Spotify Premium account (required for Web Playback SDK)
- ‚úÖ User authentication (one-time setup)
